# FFXIVSwap2Game

This project was created for the second FFXIV Swap on Tumblr. I was assigned to create something for brazenelk (that's a tumblr username) so I created this text adventure game featuring their OC, Brazen Elk! 

Plot: You are attending a masquerade party hosted by the Maelstrom. But things quickly get dark as you overhear a plot to murder the Admiral. Work with Brazen Elk to try and save her before it's too late!

Notes:
    - You can get 8 endings in the game.
    - Written entirely in Python and will run as a text adventure, tested on Windows where it opened in windows command prompt.
    - Compiled with pyinstaller.
    - Yes if you read my code I definitely took the lazy way out on some things. This was to get the project done in a timely matter knowing it's not professional work.
    - Takes place within FFXIV's universe. The only characters in this story created by me are some of the side characters you talk to. The Admiral is a canon game NPC and Brazen Elk obviously belongs to the person I am           gifting this to as stated above. I wrote the story and made the other characters up, but this is a piece of fanwork.
